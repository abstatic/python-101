      ##The If-Statement

      * You need to control the **program flow** in your programs
      * That means, if some condition is true, then certain code should be executed
      * If it is not true, either nothing should happen or some other code should be executed
      * The If-Statement helps you to do this:
        <pre><code class="python">if 1 > 2:
    print "One is bigger than two"
    # This code is actually never reached
else:
    print "One is not bigger than two"
        </code></pre>
      * The output should be:
        <pre><code class="bash">> One is not bigger than two</code></pre>
    </script>

      <h2>Exercise</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Let's build some error handling into our <strong>birthday.py</strong></li>
      </ul>

<pre><code class="python" data-trim>
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print "ERROR: Please provide a date"
else:
    BIRTHDAY = sys.argv[1]
    message = "I am born on {}".format(BIRTHDAY)
    print message
</code></pre>

      <ul>
        <li>By the way: "<strong>len</strong>" is a built-in function to return the length of a list</li>
        <li>...and "<strong>sys.argv</strong>" is just a list of command line arguments
        <li>The first argument is always the Python script filename</li>
        <li>The second argument is supposed to be birthdate</li>
      </ul>
